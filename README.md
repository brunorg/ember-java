# Ember - Java

This README outlines the details of collaborating on this Ember application.
A short introduction of this app could easily go here.

    It was a long time since I wrote this code. On that time Ember already was a mature framework, while React had just been born.
    Now this project is outdated, Ember received a lot of changes and new features, moreover, on Java land both JEE and Spring mainly the last with spring-boot made the developer life less complicated ( well, to do more and write less code ).

    Having said that, I think its a great oportunit to rewrite this code to a new version and using other technologies in Java side. So you can wait for a new version using this technologies:

    - Ember cli
    - Spring Boot
    - MongoDB
    - Docker (maybe)
