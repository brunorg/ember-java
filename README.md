Ember - Java
=====

It was a long time since I wrote this code. On that time Ember already was a mature framework, while React had just been born.
Now this project is outdated, Ember received a lot of changes and new features, moreover, on Java land both JEE and Spring mainly the last with spring-boot made the developer life less complicated ( well, to do more and write less code ).

Having said that, I think its a great oportunit to rewrite this code to a new version and using other technologies in Java side. So you can wait for a new version using this technologies:

- Ember cli
- Spring Boot
- MongoDB
- Docker (maybe)

See you soon!!
